# Global Health Expenditure Review 

### Project Description

A countryâ€™s healthcare system plays a vital role in its ability to respond effectively during health crises such as pandemics, outbreaks, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The global experience during the recent 2020 pandemic highlighted the challenges faced by countries that were unable to provide adequate care for their citizens, necessitating external support. The goal of this analysis is to uncover useful insights from macroeconomic factors and other dimensions of our database. Firstly, changes in healthcare spending over time were explored, including any significant growths or stagnations. Next, expenditure was analyzed at the global and country level to reveal any differences in spending patterns and possible inequities in healthcare access. This data also sheds light on the several insurance systems used in different countries, examining how public and private insurance models affect the overall costs. Additionally, distribution of cost across illnesses, which will help in understanding the areas receiving greatest financial attention and where the resource allocation may need to be adjusted was investigated. Finally, a Tableau dashboard was developed to illustrate the impact of investments on health outcomes across countries.
